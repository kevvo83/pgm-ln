# Week 1 PA on Credit Worthiness

Functions are documented with in-code documentation (for the most part).

Bayesian Network created by SamIAm is in the file `Credit_net.net` - this network doesn't clear 2 of the required checks of the Grader - this could be improved.

All of the other functions pass the grader 100%.
