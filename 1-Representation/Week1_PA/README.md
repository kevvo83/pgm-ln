# Week 1 PA on Credit Worthiness

Functions are documented with in-code documentation (for the most part).

Bayesian Network created by SamIAm is in the file `Credit_net.net` - this network doesn't clear 2 (out of 10 I believe) of the Grader checks - but it scores enough points to pass.

This could be improved, but at the time of submission I was pressed for time.
